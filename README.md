# Ben Caro - Portfolio

## Overview

This website serves as a comprehensive portfolio for me, Ben Caro. This site will showcase my skills, projects, and experience as a Software Engineer and various little whatever things I can think of!

Note that it is a work in progress and some things may break down on the mobile side as I'm prioritizing desktop. There may also be a lack of content at the current moment. This should all be fairly temporary :sunglasses:

**Take a look at the live site and try it out on desktop and mobile!**
